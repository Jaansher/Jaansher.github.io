    <h1>What you see</h1>
    <h3>you are looking at a
    website, it is most likely that
    your browser will be receiving
    HTML and CSS from the web
    server that hosts the site. 
    <br>
    The web browser interprets the
    HTML and CSS code to create
    the page that you see.
    <br>
    Most web pages also include
    extra content such as images,
    audio, video, or animations and
    this book will teach you how to
    prepare them for use on the web
    and then how to insert them into
    your web pages.
    <br>
    Some sites also send JavaScript
    or Flash to your browser, and you
    will see how to add JavaScript
    and Flash in your web pages.
    <br>
    Both of these technologies are
    advanced topics that you can go
    on to learn more about once you
    have mastered HTML and CSS, if
    you want to.</h3>
    <h1>HOW IT IS CREATED</h1>
    <h3>Small websites are often written
    just using HTML and CSS.
    <br>
    Larger websites — in particular
    those that are updated regularly
    and use a content management
    system (CMS), blogging tools, or
    e-commerce software — often
    make use of more complex
    technologies on the web server,
    but these technologies are
    actually used to produce HTML
    and CSS that is then sent to the
    browser. 
    <br>So, if your site uses
    these technologies, you will be
    able to use your new HTML and
    CSS knowledge to take more
    control over how your site looks.
    <br>
    Larger, more complex sites like
    these may use a database to
    store data, and programming
    languages such as PHP, ASP.Net,
    Java, or Ruby on the web server,
    but you do not need to know
    these technologies to improve
    what the user sees. The skills
    you'll learn in this book should be
    enough to help you on that road.</h3>
    <h1>HTML5 & CSS3</h1>
    <h3>Since the web was first created
    there have been several versions
    of HTML and CSS — each
    intended to be an improvement
    on the previous version.
    <Br>
    At the time of writing this
    book, HTML5 & CSS3 were
    still being developed. Although
    they had not been finalized,
    many browsers were already
    supporting some features of
    these languages and a lot of
    people were using the latest
    code on their websites.
    <br> 
    I have therefore chosen to teach you
    these latest versions.
    Because HTML5 and CSS3
    build on previous versions of
    these languages, learning these
    means you will also be able to
    understand the earlier versions
    of them. 
    <br>
    I have added clear notes
    when the code is new and also
    when it might not work in older
    browsers.</h3>
